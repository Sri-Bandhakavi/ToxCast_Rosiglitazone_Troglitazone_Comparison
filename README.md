# ToxCast_Rosiglitazone_Troglitazone_EBTC_Analysis
Differential analysis of Toxcast results for drug pair with different levels of liver toxicity - Troglitazone (mostDILI drug) vs Rosiglitazone Maleate (lessDILI)

This work was done as one of the three streams of inquiry within an ongoing systematic review for EBTC (http://www.ebtox.org/current-projects/tox21/index.html)

The aim of this stream/analysis was to evaluate if cellular/in vitro assay information present within the US EPA's Toxcast database (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxicity-forecasting) could be used to distinguis 
between drugs of differing levels of hepatotoxicity risk (eg: "mostDILI" for drugs with highest risk of liver toxicity vs "lessDILI" or "noDILI" drugs with lower or no known risk of liver toxicity).

As proof-of-concept, differences in Toxcast assay profiles were generated and compared for a "mostDILI" drug (Troglitazone) vs a "lessDILI" drug (Rosiglitazone Maleate). Power point presentation of this work also uploaded.

The protocol used for data analysis is described elsewhere (https://zenodo.org/record/2463115#.XHCbTehKg2w).
